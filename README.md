\## Run tests:

pytest -v --cov=src/



\## Run performance profiling:



python scripts/profile\_performance.py --detailed



\## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:



Automated testing on Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11



Code coverage reporting



Code quality checks



Performance benchmarking



\## Testing Strategy

Unit Tests: Individual method functionality



Integration Tests: Method interactions



Performance Tests: Scalability and optimization



Edge Case Tests: Error conditions and boundary values



\## Performance

The implementation includes:



Cached column type validation



Vectorized pandas operations



Memory-efficient processing



Comprehensive profiling with cProfile and timeit



See scripts/profile\_performance.py for detailed performance analysis.
